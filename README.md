# starting-with-java
I'm an enthusiast in Java, and I'm having an opportunity to learn JAVA with the plataform DIO.
 
DIO is doing a bootcamp with Claro, and they will teach about Java, Spring Boot, Git and GitHub and a little bit of IA.

I'm very excited to learn with DIO, and I'll show my progress on GitHub.

let's do it!!
